Function doSomethingThatMyTutorIsGonnaLike : 

This function is increasing the contrast of the input image : 
for each channel, if the intensity is under 122 we decrease the intensity by contrast (an integer defined at the begining of the function)
if the intensity is over 123, we increase the intensity by the same integer. We also make sure the intensity is not under 0 or over 255.
